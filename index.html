<b>Colored object detection</b>

We learned to identify an object with
a given color. We used the euclidean
distance in the RGB(A) color space to
find pixels that are similar to the
given color. We then find the average
location of those pixels and consider
that as the location of the object.

Click the screen on the left to change 
the color key (default is some blue).

If interested in these things, study:
- clustering: to handle more objects
- more color spaces: to identify better
